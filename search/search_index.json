This sentence details the most important things about me. Oh, I am also married to a guy named Pat. A little more about me...My educational background is in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior and I am currently a data manager and researcher for a Plant Physiological Ecology Lab at the University of Minnesota led by Dr. Jeannine Cavender-Bares. As I am winding down the end of my employment there since I relocated to Boynton Beach, Florida last January 2022, I am looking for different avenues to occupy my time. My main focus is to become a stay-at-home mom to Charlie and hopefully, one more baby (TBA). Photography is an option I've been considering. I have always had an interest in photography specifically in nature (wildlife and landscapes). I researched orangutans in Indonesia after I graduated college and traveled a bit before settling down. After I had Charlie, I have been obsessed with getting the best pictures of him. And by best, I mean candid and genuine. I like to capture moments that reflect all sides of him--his sweetness, his humor, and even his fussiness. I joke that my ultimate career goal is to create a business that pays me to take pictures of only Charlie, hence the name of my business. I am eager to experience this new journey and I hope to capture moments of you and yours with Charlie by my side (figuratively and possibly literally).","title":"About Me"},{"location":"contact/","text":"","title":"Contact"}]}
